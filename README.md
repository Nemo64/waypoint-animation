```

Callbacks can be registred, that are called every time an element becoms visible or invisible.

```javascript
  wpa.on(function(o){
    console.log(this,o);
  });
```
`this` will be concerned DOM element and the only argument passed is an `object` that contaibs informations about the positioning and the visbility of the lement.
